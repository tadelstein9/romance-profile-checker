Why This Tool Exists
After experiencing a sophisticated marriage scam that resulted in significant financial and emotional damage, I recognized the need for systematic verification tools that go beyond generic "red flag" warnings. Current scam prevention focuses on obvious tactics, but modern romance scams use sophisticated psychological manipulation and operational infrastructure.
This tool addresses:

Asset-Targeted Scams: Operations specifically designed to identify and exploit individuals with significant resources
Sophisticated Operations: Multi-person teams with professional photography, scripted conversations, and coordinated backstories
Long-Term Cons: Scams that develop over months or years before making financial requests
Technology Gaps: Lack of accessible verification tools for potential victims

Project Background
Developed by an author and systems analyst with experience in:

Technical publishing (O'Reilly Media, 14 language translations)
